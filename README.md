# mint-signup-form
This project consists of building an HTML document that matches the appearance of mint.com‚Äôs signup page
The goal here was to produce an exact replica of the sign-up page.

Here are some of the things i did

Created a blank HTML document.
Planned out how the elements on the page needed to be grouped together.
Layed out the empty semantic HTML elements for the major sections (form, sidebar, footer‚Ä¶) and made them the proper size and alignment. 
Filled in those elements with content.
Finally, styled them to look like the real webpage.

Built With
HTML and CSS
